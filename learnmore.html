                The world is a different place from just a few years ago. Managers 
                prepared their companies for Y2K, and as part of the process began 
                to examine just how vulnerable their companies were to a catastrophic 
                loss, whether by weather event, fire, terrorism or accident. The 
                key to disaster recovery is the cost of downtime in your operation. 
                COVA has developed capabilities to fit a variety of scenarios, 
                whether you need simple tape backup or want to protect your data 
                from multiple remote sites. <br>
                <br>
                Seven major highways including Interstate 20 converge at our location 
                in Abilene, Texas. Abilene Regional Airport accommodates commercial 
                and private aircraft. Abilene&#8217;s location is a strategic 
                distance from major targets for terrorism, and is out of the path 
                of hurricanes.<br>
